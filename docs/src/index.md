# SimplexPlots Documentation

SimplexPlots.jl provides functions for plotting simple [simplex plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot) (also known as ternary plots, Gibbs triangles or de Finetti diagrams depending on your field).

SimplexPlots.jl is based on the [Plots.jl](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/) ecosystem. Currently, three types of plot are supported: scatterplots (points/lines), histograms and heatmaps. The use of these is documented in the [Guide](@ref).

Please submit bugs as Issues through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hkauhanen/SimplexPlots.jl).
